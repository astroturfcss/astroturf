# Migrating to v1 (rc)

## Import Changes

In order to help folks not using React avoid extra bytes. The `styled` component
helper has moved to it's own import: `astroturf/react`, which re-exports
everything from `astroturf` as well as `styled`. To migrate automatically run the codemod:

```sh noFormat
npm install -g @codemod/cli

codemod --plugin astroturf/codemods/rename-styled-import [your files]
```

## `css` to `stylesheet`

In v1 the `css` tag will now produce a _single_ css class instead of a stylesheet.
The old behavior is still useful, so a new tag `stylesheet` has been added that
functions exactly the same way as the `css` tag pre version 1.

There is a codemod that will convert any non-css prop usages to `stylesheet`.

```sh noFormat
codemod --plugin astroturf/codemods/convert-css-to-stylesheet [your files]
```

## New Option names and defaults

The astroturf options have been changed to be clearer and with better defaults.

- `allowGlobal` is now false by default
- `tagName` -> `cssTagName`
- `styledTag` -> `styledTagName`
- added `stylesheetTagName`

## Extracted styles are imported with es module syntax

To be in a better place for tooling and optimizations astroturf now compiles
style imports to `import ... from` instead of the CommonJs `require`. This fixes
a few CSS ordering issues as well. There is no migratin step needed, but we recommend
you also enable `esmodules` option on `css-loader` as well as `mini-extract-css-plugin` for webpack.
